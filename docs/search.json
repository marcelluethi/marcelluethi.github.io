    "text": "Teaching philosophy\nI believe that what our job as educators is to create an environment in which learning can take place. This environment may or may not include a traditional classroom lecture, but that it is not the most important component. As an educator, I would like to provide a course environment that encourages the students to actively explore and experiment with the material and to make the barriers to experimentation as low as possible.\nBeing involved in all aspects of the course, not only designing the lessons but also engaging with students during the learning process, is crucial. Direct contact with the students is essential for understanding their needs, the difficulties they face and from which parts they draw most value. This is especially important in the currently, rapidly changing teaching environment. More direct contact also establishes trust between students and teachers, which I find essential for a productive learning environment.\nI found that the flipped classroom model can provide a useful framework for creating courses that put active learning and direct contact with students in focus.\n\n\nCurrent courses\n\nInformatik I (with Andreas Streich) (Course directory)\nInformatik II (with Manuela Fischer) (Course directory)\nSoftware Engineering (with Hermann Lehner and Malte Schwerhoff) (Course directory)\nData Science and Machine Learning (With Andreas Streich) (Course directory)\nDatenanalyse in der Physik (With A.

    "text": "I am a lecturer at the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich. There are three core interests that have greatly influenced my working career: How to to build better software, how to learn from data and how to use educational and computational tools to make learning engaging and active.\nMy main research topic is the modelling of analysis of medical data using statistical shape modelling. I am one of the core developers of the open source software Scalismo for shape and image analysis. I also helped to produce a MOOC on Statistical Shape Modelling and designed several other online courses. To help translate our research result into practical applications, I helped founding the company shapemeans.\nAt ETH Zurich I am currently teaching an introductory programming courses, software engineering as well as a module on Data Science and Machine Learning in the context of the Continuous Education Program."

    "text": "My research revolves around the question of how to model and quantify the variability of anatomical shapes, and how to use these models as priors in image analysis and prediction tasks. I am mainly interested in generative approaches, using Bayesian approaches and the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, with the goal of obtaining both useful prediction of partially observed structures as well as proper uncertainty quantification.\nAn important part of my research has always been to complement the algorithmic and theoretical models with software that can be used in real world application. To this end, I am one of the core-developers and maintainers of the Scalismo software, and open source software framework for model based shape and image analysis. This framework has been used in a wide variety of commercial applications and is since commercially supported by the company Shapemeans.\n\nSelected publications\nA full list of my publications can be found on my Google scholar profile.\n\nModelling\n\nDölz, J., Gerig, T., Lüthi, M., Harbrecht, H., & Vetter, T.
