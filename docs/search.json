    "text": "My research revolves around the question of how to model and quantify the variability of anatomical shapes, and how to use these models as priors in image analysis and prediction tasks. I am mainly interested in generative approaches, using Bayesian approaches and the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, with the goal of obtaining both useful prediction of partially observed structures as well as proper uncertainty quantification.\nAn important part of my research has always been to complement the algorithmic and theoretical models with software that can be used in real world applications. To this end, I am one of the core-developers and maintainers of the Scalismo software, and open source software framework for model based shape and image analysis. This framework has been used in a wide variety of commercial applications and is since commercially supported by the company Shapemeans.\n\nSelected publications\nA full list of my publications can be found on my Google scholar profile.\n\nModelling\n\nDölz, J., Gerig, T., Lüthi, M., Harbrecht, H., & Vetter, T.

    "text": "I am a lecturer at the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich. There are three core interests that have shaped my working career: How to to build better software, how to learn from data and how to use educational and computational tools to make learning engaging and active.\nMy main research topic is the modelling and analysis of medical shapes and images using statistical shape models. I am one of the core developers of the open source software Scalismo for shape and image analysis. I also helped to produce a MOOC on Statistical Shape Modelling and designed several other online courses. To help translate our research result into practical applications, I helped founding the company shapemeans.\nAt ETH Zurich I am currently teaching an introductory programming courses, software engineering as well as a module on Data Science and Machine Learning in the context of the Continuous Education Program."

    "text": "Teaching philosophy\nI believe that what our job as educators is to create an environment in which learning can take place. The focus of our attention should be to enable and facilitate learning rather than focusing narrowly on teaching. As an educator, I would like to provide a course environment that encourages the students to actively explore and experiment with the material and to make the barriers to experimentation as low as possible.\nBeing involved in all aspects of the course and engaging with students during the learning process, is crucial. Only by interacting with students we can understand the needs, the difficulties they face and from which parts they draw most value. This is especially important in the currently, rapidly changing teaching environment. More direct contact also establishes trust between students and teachers, which is most important for a productive learning environment.\nTechnology is evolving at a rapid pace and with it come great opportunities but also possible impediments for student learning. I see it as an important part of my role to engage with new technologies and guide students regarding their use in the learning process.\n\n\nCurrent courses\n\nInformatik I (with A. Streich) (Course directory)\nInformatik II (with Manuela Fischer) (Course directory)\nSoftware Engineering (with H. Lehner and M Schwerhoff) (Course directory)\nData Science and Machine Learning (with A. Streich) (Course directory)\nDatenanalyse in der Physik (with A. Eichler, M. Kroner, C.
