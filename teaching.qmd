### Teaching philosophy

I believe that what our job as educators is to create an environment in which 
learning can take place. This environment may or may not include a traditional 
classroom lecture, but that it is not the most important component. 
As an educator, I would like to provide a course environment that encourages the 
students to actively explore and experiment with the material and to make the 
barriers to experimentation as low as possible. 

Being involved in all aspects of the course, not only designing the lessons but also engaging with students during the learning process, is crucial. Direct contact with the students is essential for understanding their needs, the difficulties 
they face and from which parts they draw most value. This is especially important in the currently, rapidly changing
teaching environment. More direct contact also establishes trust between students and teachers, which 
I find essential for a productive learning environment. 

I found that the flipped classroom model can provide a useful framework for creating courses that put active learning 
and direct contact with students in focus.
