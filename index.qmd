I am a lecturer at the [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/de/) at ETH Zurich. There are three core interests that have greatly influenced my working career: How to to build better software, how to learn from data and how to use educational and computational tools to make learning engaging and active.

My main research topic is the modelling of analysis of medical data using statistical shape modelling. I am one of the core developers of the open source software [Scalismo](https://www.scalismo.org) for shape and image analysis. I also helped to produce a [MOOC on Statistical Shape Modelling](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/statistical-shape-modelling) and designed several 
other online courses. To help translate our research result into practical applications, I helped founding the company [shapemeans](https://shapemeans.com/).

At ETH Zurich I am currently teaching an introductory programming courses, software engineering as well 
as a module on [Data Science and Machine Learning](https://inf.ethz.ch/continuing-education/cas-datamachinelearning.html) in the context of the Continuous Education Program.
